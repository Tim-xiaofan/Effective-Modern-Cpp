# Item 23: Understand std::move and std::forward
## Things to Remember
* `std::move performs` an unconditional cast to an rvalue. In and of itself, it
doesn’t move anything.
* `std::forward` casts its argument to an rvalue only if that argument is bound
to an rvalue.
* Neither `std::move` nor `std::forward` do anything at runtime.
